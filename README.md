# WiMLDS Starter Kit for New Chapters

## Overview of WiMLDS

**Mission: Our mission is to support and promote women and gender minorities who are practicing, studying or are interested in the fields of machine learning and data science.** 

We create opportunities for members to engage in technical and professional conversations in a positive, supportive environment by hosting talks by women and gender minority individuals working in data science or machine learning, as well as hosting technical workshops, networking events and hackathons.  Our events are inclusive to anyone who supports our cause regardless of gender identity or technical background. However, in support of our mission, we encourage women and gender minorities as speakers at our events.

**_The term "women and gender minorities" is inclusive of women (trans and cis), trans-men, and persons who are non-binary, genderqueer, genderfluid, agender, intersex, and all other minority genders._**

### Organizational Structure & Legal Entities

WiMLDS is a 501(c)3 non-profit corporation in New York, NY, USA.  The organization started in San Francisco, California in 2013 (with [WiMLDS Bay Area](http://wimlds.org/chapters/about-the-bay-area-team/)) and we now have [chapters](http://wimlds.org/chapters/) all over the world.

## Agreements

- **Leadership**  
Leadership roles within WiMLDS chapters, particularly organizer or co-organizer roles, are to be held by women and gender minorities.
- **Accessibility**  
Provision of FREE events based on a combination of volunteering and funding/sponsorship where available.
- **No commercial agenda**  
Chapters are started by individuals, not by companies.  Chapters can partner with companies for sponsorship in the form of venue space, food or other supplies.  Chapters and events may not be ‘used’ by a corporation/as a commercial vehicle for private aims.  This also means that **speakers cannot give talks about paid products/services**, even if they don't work at the company offering the product/service.

## Terms
- **Event frequency**  
Organizers agree to organize at least one event every six months (though we encourage your chapter to have at least one event every 1-3 months).
